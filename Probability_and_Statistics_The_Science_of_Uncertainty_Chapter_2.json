            <dd>Since $s^2$ is strictly increasing as $s \rightarrow \infty$ we know that X(1) will be our minimum value, Therefore $min_{s\in S}X(s)=1^2=1$</dd>
            <dt>(b)$max_{s\in S}X(s)$</dt>
            <dd>Since $s^2$ is strictly increasing without bound as $s \rightarrow \infty$ and since our sample space goes to positive infinity, we can conclude that X(s) is an unbounded random variable. Similar to Example 2.1.10 from the textbook. Therefore,$max_{s\in S}X(s)=DNE(Does Not Exist)$</dd>
            <dt>(c)$min_{s\in S}Y(s)$</dt>
            <dd>Does not exist, since our sample space S goes from $1\rightarrow\infty$<br>
            we should look at the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ where $x\in \mathbb{W}$ since our function is strictly decreasing on this domain naturally the largest number in our sample space S would produce our minimum value. Since we cannot plug $s=\infty$ into $Y(s)$ we know that there is no minimum.<br>
            In other words: since $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)=0$ our minimum value should be zero, but since there is no $s\in S$ such that $Y(s)=0$ the minimum does not exist.</dd>
            <dt>(d)$max_{s\in S}Y(s)$</dt>
            <dd>Since our function is strictly decreasing on its domain(the sample space). We know that $Y(s)=max_{s\in S}Y(s)$ when s is the lowest possible number, in this case that means that $s=1$ therefore, $max_{s\in S}Y(s)=Y(1)=1$</dd>

        No, for example let $S=\{1,2,3,4...\}$ and let $X(s)=-s$. No c will exist such that $X+c\geq 0$ as an s can always be chosen to make $X+c\leq 0$

        Yes, in a finite sample space, if we set $c=min_{s\in S}X(s)$ then we would have $X+c\geq 0$

        we can find the definition of unbounded from Example 2.1.10: if X(s) increases or decreases without bound as $s\rightarrow\infty$ X can be called an unbounded random variable.<br>
        If our sample space is finite we can not have an unbounded random variable on S. This is because we must have an upper bound defined by $max_{s\in S}X(s)$ and a lower one defined by: $min_{s\in S}X(s)$.

        ",
        "answer":"
        Yes, X does have to be an indicator function. The definition of an indicator function from Example 2.1.6: An indicator function is any function that can output only the values 0 and 1. If A is a subset of X for any set X, then the indicator function $\textit{I}_A: X \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is defined by:
$$
\textit{I}_A(x)=\begin{cases}1&x\in\textbf{A}\\ 0&x\notin\textbf{A}\end{cases} 
$$
Therefore no matter how we define our function $X$ we can always determine a set where for all $a\in A$ $\textbf{A}$ where $X(a)=1$ which fits our definition of the indicator function given above

        The number of unique indicator functions we can define on s will be equal to the number of possible subsets of S that we can create.
        The formula to find the maximum number of subsets including the empty set is $2^n$ where n represents the number of elements in your set.<br>
        In this case, we could define $2^m$ many different indicator functions on S.

        <dd>
        We can simply write the probabilities we calculated above multiplied by the indicator function for that outcome, the sum of them all will represent the probability of $\textbf{B$}.
        $$P(X\in \textbf{B})=\frac{1}{8}\textit{I}_B(0)+\frac{3}{8}\textit{I}_B(1)+\frac{2}{8}\textit{I}_B(2)+\frac{1}{8}\textit{I}_B(3)$$
        Alternatively, assuming n many coin tosses, we have $2^n$ many possible outcomes, of those outcomes we have $n \choose x$ many ideal outcomes where x represents the desired number of coins showing heads.<br>
        $$\frac{n\choose x}{2^n}$$
        This equation represents the probability of having x many heads in n many coin tosses. 
        $$P(X\in \textbf{B})=\frac{3\choose 0}{2^3}\textit{I}_B(0)+\frac{3\choose 1}{2^3}\textit{I}_B(1)+\frac{3\choose 2}{2^3}\textit{I}_B(2)+\frac{3\choose 3}{2^3}\textit{I}_B(3)$$
        Note that this equation simplifies to exactly the same one as above.

        This question just like the last one just wants us to sum up all probabilities multiplied by the indicator function to check if that outcome is in $\textbf{B}$
        $$P(Y\in \textbf{B})=\frac{1}{36}\textit{I}_B(2)+\frac{2}{36}\textit{I}_B(3)+\frac{3}{36}\textit{I}_B(4)+\frac{4}{36}\textit{I}_B(5)+\frac{5}{36}\textit{I}_B(6)+\frac{6}{36}\textit{I}_B(7)+\frac{5}{36}\textit{I}_B(8)+\frac{4}{36}\textit{I}_B(9)+\frac{3}{36}\textit{I}_B(10)+\frac{2}{36}\textit{I}_B(11)+\frac{1}{36}\textit{I}_B(12)$$
        We can factor to simplify this to the following:
        $$P(Y\in \textbf{B})=\frac{1}{36}(\textit{I}_B(2)+\textit{I}_B(12))+\frac{2}{36}(\textit{I}_B(3)+\textit{I}_B(11))+\frac{3}{36}(\textit{I}_B(4)+\textit{I}_B(10))+\frac{4}{36}(\textit{I}_B(5)+\textit{I}_B(9))+\frac{5}{36}(\textit{I}_B(6)+\textit{I}_B(8))+\frac{6}{36}\textit{I}_B(7)$$
