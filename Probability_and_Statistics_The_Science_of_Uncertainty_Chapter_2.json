            we should look at the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ where $x\in \mathbb{W}$ since our function is strictly decreasing on this domain naturally the largest number in our sample space S would produce our minimum value. Since we cannot plug $s=\infty$ into $Y(s)$ we know that there is no minimum.<br>
            In other words: since $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)=0$ our minimum value should be zero, but since there is no $s\in S$ such that $Y(s)=0$ the minimum does not exist.</dd>

            <dd>Since our function is strictly decreasing on its domain(the sample space). We know that $Y(s)=max_{s\in S}Y(s)$ when s is the lowest possible number, in this case that means that $s=1$ therefore, $max_{s\in S}Y(s)=Y(1)=1$</dd>
