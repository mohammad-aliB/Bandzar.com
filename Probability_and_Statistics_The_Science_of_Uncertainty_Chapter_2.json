          <dd>Since $s^2$ is strictly increasing as $s \rightarrow \inf$ we know that X(1) will be our minimum value, therefore min_{s\in S}X(S)=1^2=1</dd>
          <dt>(a)$max_{s\in S}X(S)$</dt>
          <dd>Since $s^2$ is strictly increasing without bound as $s \rightarrow \inf$ and since our sample space goes to positive infinity, we can conclude that X(s) is an unbounded random variable. Similar to example 2.1.10 from the textbook</dd>
