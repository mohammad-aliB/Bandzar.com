        "question":"Two balls are drawn in succession and without replacement, from a jar containing eight red balls and four white balls. What is the probability that the first ball was white given that the second ball was red? Use Bayes' theorem",
        "answer":"
        Lets let:<br>
        $W_1$ represent the probability that the first ball drawn is white<br>
        $R_1$ represent the probability that the first ball drawn is Blue<br>
        $W_2$ represent the probability that the Second ball drawn is White<br>
        $R_2$ represent the probability that the Second ball drawn is Blue<br>
        We will start off by finding the probability that the second ball drawn is red<br>
        $$P(R_2)=(R_2\cap W_1)+(R_2\cap R_1)$$
        $$P(R_2\cap W_1)=\frac{4}{12}\times\frac{8}{11}$$
        $$P(R_2\cap W_1)=\frac{8}{33}$$
        $$P(R_2\cap R_1)=\frac{8}{12}\times\frac{7}{11}$$
        $$P(R_2\cap R_1)=\frac{14}{33}$$
        $$P(R_2)=(R_2\cap W_1)+(R_2\cap R_1)$$
        $$P(R_2)=\frac{8}{33} + \frac{14}{33}$$
        $$P(R_2)=\frac{22}{33}$$
        Now we want to apply the conditional probabilty function:<br>
        $$P(W_1|R_2)=\frac{P(W_1\cap R_2)}{P(R_2)}$$
        $$P(W_1|R_2)=\frac{\frac{8}{33}}{\frac{22}{33}}$$
        $$P(W_1|R_2)=\frac{8}{22}$$
        $$P(W_1|R_2)=\frac{4}{11}$$
        Therefore the probability that the first ball was white given that the second ball was red is $P(W_1|R_2)=\frac{4}{11}$
