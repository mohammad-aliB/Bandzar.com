<p>
    Hello my name is Mohammad-Ali Bandzar. I am a senior studnet at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute. Im a hard working student who is dedicated to succeed and do well. My best skill is procrastination which gives me a natural attraction towards classes with little to no homework which is why mathamatics courses are my favourite. On the otherhand i struggle with English as it is one of my lowest grades, but that doesn't prevent me from trying my best. I always give it my all and never give up. When it comes to group work I try my best not to be the worst preformer so i do not end up with all the blame.
</p>
<p>
If you asked them, my friends(imaginary) would describe me as kind, welcoming person and I couldnt agree more, after all how could i possibly disagree with the voices in my head. Furtheremore I always try my best to include everybody in activities when possible because it is always nice to apply collective efforts to problems. Also No one wants to be left out/alone which is an expirence which I would know all about. I also enjoy meeting new people and hearing about their unique life expirences.
</p>
<p>
    My hobbies include the following:
    <ol>
        <li>going to the gym</li>
        <li>contemplating dropping out of school</li>
        <li>Failing ICS tests</li>
        <li>Losing sleep ove ICS</li>
    </ol>
